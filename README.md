This package contains the V2X message types of CAM, CPM, DENM and SPAT standards.

The dependencies of these messages can be seen in the respective dependencies.pdf.

This package can be downloaded and built like any other ROS2 package. It needs to be added as a dependency in the package.xml of the package that would use these message types.
